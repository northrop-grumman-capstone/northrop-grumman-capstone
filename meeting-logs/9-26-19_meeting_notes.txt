Objective 

NO GOOGLE DRIVE
-- April presentation 

- Track vehicle through scenes in a video and classify them (improve by treating inputs dependently)
- Existing model will change decision throughout the scene

Minimum of 4 algorithms
	- research new algorithms

Get classification accuracy as high as possible
history bears some weight, but not too much that the beginning trumps everything

_REQUIRED_
~Attention (in NLP points to comparing to the whole dataset, embedding)
~Long short term memory
~RNN
~TCNN

Needs to be ~~~efficient~~~
	- process within seconds
	- how much data does it need to be performant (best accuracy with fewest inputs)
	- can handle a little bit of data, missing data
	- online learning?? 
	- !!REAL TIME ANSWER!!
	- autonomous accuracy
	- ensemble approach?
	- 80%
	res-net?
	- datathroughput and noisy data

- May be provided with hardware


IDEAL - 
1) improve on baseline better than one input in isolation (80%)
2) comparison of the algorithms with code to back it up (in different aspects - efficiency, accuracy, noise)
3) best - get to real time 90% classification with 
4) Collect data maybe??

first steps -- datasets to use, algorithms to compare, where to store
